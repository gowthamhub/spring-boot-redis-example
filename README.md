#Spring-Boot
Spring Boot With Redis Server and Lombok Feature.

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

Redis is made on C programming and is super fast.

You can download Redis from https://redis.io/download

For Windows OS download the .exe file or the .msi file and install. Its easy on windows as you do not need to manually start the server.

But in Linux you need download the files and extract and manually start the server by going on to the src location of the extracted file.

To make use of the Lombok feature you need maven dependency and lombok plugin downloaded from the plugins section of Intellij.

Lastly, you can always make and generate a project from "start.spring.io" site
